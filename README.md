### Vim plugin to deal with python pyxl

Pyxl detection, syntax, and indent files. The easiest way to install the vim support is via [vim-pug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug);

``vim
  Plug 'charlieonor/pyxl-vim';
``

This was originaly forked from [pyxl](https://github.com/dropbox/pyxl); Inorder to remove the manual installation. All I did was move the files to the root.
